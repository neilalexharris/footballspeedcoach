Has exercising become all about body image? Today there is so much focus on how we look, with the main focus on 
losing weight to feel better about ourselves.
Along the way we seem to have lost the basic fundamental of exercise - health. We are losing the understanding 
that looking good is a by-product of being healthy. Exercise is about healthy bodies and healthy minds and exercising for our well-being.
 

People would perhaps feel under less pressure in our society in general, if we exercised to gain health benefits for both body 
and mind and we enjoyed the rewards of this - feeling better mentally, reducing stress, being in better health physically, reducing 
our risk of diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes etc.


As we do this, as we stop weight-loss being the focus and understand it will happening naturally as part of the correct programme 
under the correct guidance, we can go some way to people enjoying exercise for what it is. The ability to move, get healthy and feel 
great. Letâ€™s not allow our profession to go the way of so many areas of our society, with the focus solely on body image and not on 
well-being.
