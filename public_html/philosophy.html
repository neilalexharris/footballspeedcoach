					<h3 class="block_title">Bodyweight Strength</h1>
					</br>
					
					<p>When it comes to strength, the ability to master one's own bodyweight is often lost, and the focus switches to mastering a barbell, or weighted machine. 
					By isolating muscles, people can develop imbalances in muscular strength and often suffer injuries. I use equipment - such as the 
					<a class="pink" href="http://www.trxtraining.com/" target="blank">TRX</a> - to assist in building supreme total body strength, balance 
					and stability. By working the body unilaterally I ensure everyone has a stable base from which to develop and progress.</p>
					<br/>

					<p>At <font class="pink">Tatum Nelson Fitness</font>, the focus is on total body strength, and attaining power that belies ones size.</p> 
				</div>
			
				<div class="col-4 pad-block">
					<h3 class="block_title">Core Stability</h1>
					<br/>

					<p>A strong core forms the platform from which a high level of fitness can be built and is as important 
					for a casual gym-goer as it is for an Olympic Athlete.</p>
					<br/>

					<p>Without developing the core, fitness gains will be limited, progression will be slow and 
					the risk of injury will increase.</p>
					<br/>

					<p>At <font class="pink">Tatum Nelson Fitness</font>, foundations will be built so the client can continue to achieve.</p>

					<h3 class="block_title">Cardiovascular Fitness</h1>
					<br/>
			
					<p>Cardiovascular fitness plays a leading role in overall health, and is often neglected in 
					today's busy lifestyles.</p>
					<br/>

					<p>Tatum will ensure this is not the case and through her training regimes she will include 
					elements to nurture and improve this whether it be apparent to you, or cleverly disguised 
					for the person who hates cardio work!</p>
					<br/>

					<p>At <font class="pink">Tatum Nelson Fitness</font> cardiovascular health will lead to you feeling better, having more 
					energy and losing weight as an added benefit!</p>

			<p>Tatum has developed a unique, effective approach to fitness that has proven success.</p>
			<br/>

			<p>She brings together her background as an elite athlete and her years of studying ballet to create
			the perfect full body work out that will leave you feeling invigorated!</p>
			<br/>

			<p>Both men and women can benefit from Tatum's approach - it is simple:</p>
			<br/>
			
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-6 pad-block">
					<h3 class="block_title">Tatum Nelson Fitness for Him</h3>
					</br>
					<p>"I have trained alongside the best 
					male athletes in the world, I have spent time studying and learning how they develop their 
					physiques, and for male clients I place more emphasis on this skill set honing an enviable physique 
					and gaining superior strength."</p>
					<br/>
				</div>
				
				<div class="col-6 pad-block">
					<h3 class="block_title">Tatum Nelson Fitness For Her</h3>
					</br>
					<p>"I practised ballet for years, and 
					reached elementary level, the highest grade that can be taken. My passion for dance and my 
					experience of the amazing benefits it can have on the way you not only feel but also how your body 
					looks has led me to integrate it into my workouts. Basing more of the workout on ballet to develop 
					lean, beautiful, elongated muscles."</p>
					<br/>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>Of course there's nothing to say the emphasis has to be this way! I will tailor the workout 
			to suit your needs.</p>
