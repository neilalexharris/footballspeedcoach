							<p>
              Speedwork and sprint training are essential components of football.
              In the ever increasingly competitive world of sport, the right speed training and sprint technique
              will give young footballers the edge, and take their game to the next level.
							<br><br>
							Through my <span class='orange'>“7 Point Speed Training Programme"</span> I incorporate all of the speed training footballers need from sprint technique and focussed specific speed work to acceleration, change of
							direction, plyometrics, and everything in between.
							<br><br>
							I will analyse sprint technique, make any necessary adaptations, apply my speed
							programme and I will improve the speed of any footballer.
							<br><br>
							In addition to speed and sprint work I include specific training designed to build and
							maintain the fitness base required for football. This includes football focussed conditioning work,
							circuit training and injury prevention which are all key to longevity and continuity of football
							training.

							<h3>Why Speed Training With Me?</h3><br>
							<p>
							Drawing on my background as an international GB sprinter, when I work with footballers, I apply
              the sprint techniques and speed training that I have learned covering every
              element of speedwork needed to improve the performance in their game.
							<br><br>
              I started sprinting at the age of 11, competed for England by the age of 13 and was one of the
              fastest girls in the world by the age of 14. I have trained and competed at the highest level of
              sprinting being fortunate enough to travel the world gaining invaluable and incomparable
              knowledge. I have trained alongside some of the greatest coaches and athletes in the world and
              I now place all of this knowledge into football speed training with me.
              <br><br>

Always attentive, she has the amazing ability to provide just the right practical advice and encouragement I need to achieve my goals. She expertly adapts my sessions to my needs – ranging from Pilates to a full-on HIIT routine. Sessions are always fun and exhilarating! <i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i></p>

											<p class="blockquote"><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> I have suffered with chronic back issues for many years - seeing all manner of physios and osteopaths - until I started working with Tatum. Within the first 5 minutes of our first session, Tatum noticed a hip imbalance, and then spent the next few sessions working to build strength and stability. Not only am I now pain free, but I feel better than I ever have, and look forward to every session <i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i></p>

											<p class="blockquote"><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> It was the best decision I made to train with Tatum. She was able to truly listen and understand my concerns and aspirations and personalise my workout programmes as needed. I was able to train throughout the pandemic due to the virtual training setup which was so convenient to be able to fit in between my busy work life as a key worker.</p>
											<p class="blockquote"> I had been training before starting with Tatum but was finding myself injury prone and often experiencing pain. Within a matter of weeks these aches and pains subsided and I feel Tatum was able to strike that careful balance of HIIT with controlled weight training and pilates style exercises.</p>
