							<p>
              Speedwork and sprint training are essential components of football.
              In the ever increasingly competitive world of sport, the right speed training and sprint technique
              will give young footballers the edge, and take their game to the next level.
							<br><br>
							Through my <span class='orange'>â€œ7 Point Speed Training Programme"</span> I incorporate all of the speed training footballers need from sprint technique and focussed specific speed work to acceleration, change of
							direction, plyometrics, and everything in between.
							<br><br>
							I will analyse sprint technique, make any necessary adaptations, apply my speed
							programme and I will improve the speed of any footballer.
							<br><br>
							In addition to speed and sprint work I include specific training designed to build and
							maintain the fitness base required for football. This includes football focussed conditioning work,
							circuit training and injury prevention which are all key to longevity and continuity of football
							training.

							<h3>Why Speed Training With Me?</h3><br>
							<p>
							Drawing on my background as an international GB sprinter, when I work with footballers, I apply
              the sprint techniques and speed training that I have learned covering every
              element of speedwork needed to improve the performance in their game.
							<br><br>
              I started sprinting at the age of 11, competed for England by the age of 13 and was one of the
              fastest girls in the world by the age of 14. I have trained and competed at the highest level of
              sprinting being fortunate enough to travel the world gaining invaluable and incomparable
              knowledge. I have trained alongside some of the greatest coaches and athletes in the world and
              I now place all of this knowledge into football speed training with me.
              <br><br>

													<p class="blockquote"><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> Tatum has been exceptional with my team. We have always suffered with our pace as a squad and the training she delivered has made a real difference. Following our 3 weeks initial training, the techniques that Tatum worked on can be seen and improvements are noticeable. I am being approached by parents already about continuing the training. She has such a good way with the boys, her nickname for one of our players has stuck too and they still call him it today! I have already recommended her to some friends' teams and would to anyone <i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i></p>

													<p class="blockquote"><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> Tatum spent 20 minutes with 4 of our groups over a 5 week period, working on fundamental sprinting technique. The sessions gave our players a better understanding of how to move their body to increase form and therefore speed. The drills are intense, which helped push the players to improve. Tatum clearly has a wealth of knowledge, but was particularly good at breaking it down into a fun and engaging session for our players to process. Would highly recommend The Football Speed Coach to anyone looking to gain an edge in all sports that require speed <i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i></p>
