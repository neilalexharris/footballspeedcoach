						<h1 class="lightblue">Run Analysis</h1><br/>
						<p>In the present day, most gym and personal training facilities offer some kind of biomechanical running analysis, using an array of complex computers, scanners and video. But do they actually achieve what they are there for?</p>
						<br/> 

						<p>Tatum learnt the hard way that they often do not guarantee a result that will have you running more efficiently 
						and effectively. Tatum draws on her 20 years experience at the athletics track, and the knowledge she has gathered 
						from some of the best physiotherapists and analysts from around the world to give you straight-to-the-point advice 
						about running technique, shoes and biomechanics</p>
						<br/>

						<p class="lightblue" align="center">Over a series of sessions Tatum will change the way you run, forever, for the better</p>
						<br/>

						<h1 class="lightblue">Triathlon Conditioning</h1>
						<br/>
						<p class="lightblue">“A body that is prepared and conditioned for your sport is a body that will achieve”</p>
						<br/>

						<p>During recent years Tatum has developed a passion for helping the triathlete supersede their expectation by 
						aiding their training process.</p>
						<br/>

						<p>Most triathletes are meticulous with their running, cycling and swimming regimes but more often than not 
						will pick up an illness or injury at a crucial point in their pre-season preparation.</p>
						<br/>

						<p>After continually watching triathletes put in the miles and train to their limit, it is clear something
						is missing and changes have to be made.  By conditioning the body the right way, we can ensure that you can 
						keep progressing in both competition and training and get the maximum out of your performance.</p>
						<br/>

						<p>With proven success in working with triathletes Tatum Nelson Fitness will create a programme that 
						will enhance your training, allowing you to not only improve in competition but to train with confidence</p>

						<img class="padding" src="Images/Photos/jh_rugby_bw_125.png" align="right"/>
		    			<h1 class="lightblue">Sports Specific Conditioning</h1>
						<br/>
						<p>Programmes include:</p>
						<ul>
							<div class="lightblue">
								<li><span class="whitetext">Golf</span></li>

								<li><span class="whitetext">Swimming</span></li>
								<li><span class="whitetext">Cycling</span></li>
							</div>
						</ul>
						<p>Whatever your discipline, Tatum can offer sport specific conditioning to improve your performance.</p>
						<br/>
						<p>By discussing your objectives, and testing for your strengths and weaknesses, Tatum will build a 
						highly specific programme so that you can go further, go faster, and hit harder</p>



						<img class="padding" src="Images/Photos/medal_125.png" align="right"/>
			    		<h1 class="lightblue">Event Preparation Plans</h1><br/>
			    		<p>Providing preparation for events ranging from 5km and 10km runs to cycling sportives, at Tatum Nelson Fitness, we can structure a 6, 8, or even 12 week plan purely for that single event.</p>
						<br/>
						<p>There is nothing like standing on the start line knowing that you are 100% prepared.  With a specific plan the guesswork can be eliminated and you can ensure that everything in the training leading up to the event is tailored for your goal.</p>
